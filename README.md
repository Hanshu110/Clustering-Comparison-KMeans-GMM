# Clustering-Comparison-KMeans-GMM
This code demonstrates an unsupervised clustering experiment where two common clustering techniques, K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), are applied to a dataset for comparison. The dataset contains 30 samples, each with 3 features representing hypothetical attributes like age, height, and weight.
